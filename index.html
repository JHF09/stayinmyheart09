    <h1><center>Stay in my Heart</center></h1>
    <p>
      There was a guy named grey in a city who's parents always fought. He was
      tired of them and he met a girl who just lost her mother and grey heard
      that she was having a heart problem and mental breakdown of it and grey
      went to talk to her about her opinion of her mother and grey said he
      wished he could the same if his mother ever died. She is lucky to have a
      good mother since you can't really choose your parents when you are born.
      Grey manages to flatter the girl and it is a romour that later that girl
      died out of heart attack but who believes in roumurs? On this side grey
      when he was 10 he was in his room hearing all the shouting ouside. His
      parents are fighting again. He's tired of it and it can be seen clearly by
      his face. His mother grabbes a knife. What happens next is not shown.
      <br />
      <br />
      It's that girl her name wel'll call stephine for now. Stephine has heart
      problems and randly her heart beat starts increaisng when she's stressed
      or something. It's a pain for someone who's so emotional. Rather it's her
      root cause that she's so emotional which bame the entire reasonf for her
      mental and heart problems themselves. She still remembers th guy who was
      too nice to her whom she fell in love just as a child. Having a childhood
      lover may be nice but not when it's one sided or specially when you don't
      even know his name at all. It's highschool where she isn't happy. She has
      a friendgroup but she doesn't understands their jokes and creates a
      problem everytime they say something offensive. She has isolated herself.
      She believes everyone hates her even though it's not true. She graduated
      from class 8 and now it's time for grade 9 for which she went to a
      different school since their school only teaches till class 8. She spend
      11 years in a single school and she's only in class 9 now. That's wild.
      She exchanges class. And on this side grey was in the same school walking
      with some girl named jessika. They weren't talking much and grey talked
      about break up.
      <br />
      <br />
      Seems like they are not getting along and jessika said yes. They should
      indeed. But then grey saw a car coming and though to stop by to let the
      car pass but then a kid was about to be crushed by the car. Grey jumpes
      forward saving the boy but in the end he got into an accident with a bike
      from which the boy survibed who'm grey was holding tightely more as if
      it's something more than important himself. His head took a hit from a
      iron pole which he flew to. The little kid was safe but the same can't be
      said for grey. The kid was confused as his mother came and hugged him. The
      kid saw blood flowing down from the person who came to save him. everyone
      was shocked. On this side a guy named arvin was talking to a guy named
      griffin. They can see many similer faces since they got a lot of new
      classmates in this year and they think if more of friends they know are
      here. Stephine entered the room and even though she saw similer faces all
      over the classroom she couldn't comprihend the reason no one was talking
      to her. No one was giving her attention. As if something had happend. She
      did something. She wonders if she is looking wierd in any way or not. She
      has a heart rate meter which she uses and concludes that for no reason she
      has 100 heart rate all of the time. Which is around 97 98 but it's still
      higher than...I guess I am making up reasons.
      <br />
      <br />
      The lowest hear rate she has seen in the past years is only 100. That's it
      for the explanation. The teacher comes and starts taking attendence and
      jessika came in and told the teacher about what happend and the moment few
      of the students realized what happend they immidiately took a leave and
      evne the teacher took a leave after taking the attendence. It was urgent.
      It's cause grey was like a really well known guy in the class and all. He
      had loyal friends and all and even the teacher thought that guy was speial
      or something. They all went to the hospital and stephine was confused. She
      instantly realized that this guy was special but who is he? She went home
      and her father told her that he's the exact guy who she wanted to marry
      when she was young and she was confused. Turns out when she met grey first
      she told her father that if she ever marries someone it must be him. Just
      a child thing when your parents always talk about when you grow up and
      marry. She was embarresed but the next moment she realized that grey got
      into an accident and she wanted to go and her father decided to take her
      to there and on their way her father whom I can call steven for now.
      Steven explains that grey's parent's got divorsed after they got into a
      bloody bath and seems like steven supports almost every wish of stephine
      cause he loves his daughter and do anything at all she wises cause he
      knows she can die out of fast heart rate anytime.
      <br />
      <br />
      He can't affort to make her sad. They went to the hospital and they went
      to meet the boy but turns out grey wasn't even in that hospital and
      stephine called her friend and seems like she wasn't even told any
      hospital names. How did she got the name of that hospital then? He's in a
      different hospital that is out of the town and her father was willing to
      take her there and stephine says no. She doesn't wants her father to
      struggle for nothing and she think and says something doesn't makes sence.
      If the location of the hospital is really that far away from the school
      then how did their teacher say it'll take 10 minutes from there to reach
      the hospital? Something doesn't adds up. Were they talking about train or
      bus? And on top of everything why will a paitent that needs immidiate care
      will be transported so far? Then an entire month passes by and stephine
      hears that grey will be coming to school today and she was happy to hear
      he's in a good health and wondered if he has any impact or anything since
      she dosen't knows what to do exactly when he comes back. She isn't friends
      with him or naything at all. She can try messeging him but she doesn't
      knows. One of her friend came and started treating stephine really bad and
      she immidiately left and suddenly everyone's position changed. Then on
      this side grey was sleeping in his house alone and he is the only one who
      lives in this apartment where he lives with his father yet he still has
      connection to his mother.
      <br />
      <br />
      Grey get's a call from his mother that he must go to school today cause he
      didn't went to school for 30 entire days and grey says that he littelery
      had been bleeding and his mother talked how he just scrached his body and
      just a little head bumb that he was indeed bleeding but nothing serious
      since after bandeging and daily check up it's almost healed. After an
      entire months it'll be un noticable. Grey didn't wanted to go since he can
      still stay at leave by pretending to be sick but his mother theretends
      that if he doens't goes then she'll call him a thousand times and even if
      she needs to call from a different number she'll do when grey blocks her.
      Grey had no choise. He had his bandage that he had on his head that he
      could just remove his he doesn't needs it but he decided to wear it so
      show off to his friends like it's a highschool thing to show someone that
      I'm wearing bandage to gain symphyty or get attention. But the exact
      moment grey went outside of house hestart sweating. He removed his bandage
      cause he doesn't cares about attention. Sweating his real enimy. Grey's
      father in a sleepy state came and gave him some money before he left. He
      seemed like a robot for no reason. There is a reason. On this side the
      teacher was taking attendecne and during that time grey entered the class
      room at the exact moment his name was said. His friend arvin almost hugged
      him and grey barely managed to get away since his entire body is sweaty.
      <br />
      <br />
      Stephine was happy seeing grey but she didn't knew what to do since it's
      been years since she met him and grey sat exactly next to her. It's his
      seat. Everything became fun all of a start. Everyone started talking and
      grey had the loudest voice in the entire class. Stephine wanted to talk to
      grey too but she was too shy to do so and suddenly the entire environment
      changes again. It's all too quit when the teacher asked stephine a
      question. Matter of fact grey is nowhere to be seen. Where did he went?
      Then she looked back and grey was sitting at his exact place and then he
      looked at stephine and wondered if it was a similer face. One of the girls
      jessika told grey that it's his childhood crush and the entire class
      starts making noice. Even the teacher was shocked. He told the class to
      let him teach. He started talking his borring lecture again. Then on this
      side grey was embarresed cause he completely forgot the existence of
      stephine and asked what her name was and she told grey her name. That was
      quite wholesome. I guess it's easy for anyone to forget their name as long
      as they are not in touch. Then during lunch stephine was eating alone and
      grey was talking to his friends when he saw stephine and asked his friends
      about that girl.
      <br />
      <br />
      And after hearing that she's a wierdo grey went forward to stephine to ask
      to eat with them and she didn't accepted cause there were other people.
      Then during lunch grey talked about how he forgot to bring his phone cause
      he wanted to call ali. Another one of their friend. You know what. I
      messed up. Goatta change ali and arvin's name with eachother cause I
      forgot whom to introduce first. Stephine tells grey that he can use her
      phone and grey didn't wanted to but she told grye that he can use it and
      grey decided to go to the school roof for privecy. Grey was walking on the
      edge where there is a small piller type made with bricks. Grey was walking
      dangeriously while talking to one of his friend arvin. This arvin is in a
      different city. He's at home cause he didn't went to school and grey talks
      about how he met the girl he had a crush on during childhood. On this side
      stephine was actually standing behind the walls to peak on grey's
      conversation cause it's her phone afterall. Grey was talking how
      everything went like he saved a child but grey thought that's a bit wierd
      how things played. Usually when you see it in films when someone save
      someone it looks heroic yet in real life when grey saved that child he
      felt worthless cause he didn't managed to make the situation entirely
      safe. He went to hospital for that idioticy.
      <br />
      <br />
      Maybe if he reacted properly then he would have gotten back with the child
      insted of taking it in front knowing very well that it could have been
      much worse. A bus, a truck?? Or even another car. Grey feels like the
      credit should go to god for that insted of him cause it was all luck. And
      grey joked about jumping and almost slipped. But he was saved by stephine
      and when she tried to hold him back so he doesn't falls grey fell in her
      arm. Grey asked if she was ok but seems like there were tears in her eyes.
      She told grey that he's an idiot and showed her consern if he fell. Grey
      cut the call and apologised and returned her phone. Grey decided to wipe
      her tears up and apologised for making her worry and she was embarred so
      she left. Today for some reason her friend jessika was talking very nicely
      to her about everything. She said stephine is wierd for no reason.
      Stephine on her way home was really happy and her father asked what
      happend and she said she talked to him and her father asked his name and
      stephine said but seems like something is wierd. Something doesn't adds up
      and she couldn't figure it out why. while in her room she noticed that she
      got arvin's number so she called arvin to get grey's number and when she
      did she called grey and grey was talking really nicely to stephine and
      remembers the exact worlds he said to stephine back then when he met her
      first on that hospital.
      <br />
      <br />
      Grey talks how it sounds like a love story of first meet and stephine
      wonders why not make it one and grey asks stephine if she wishes to
      fuilfill that dream maybe and she says yes. She was willing to go on a
      date instantly with someone she wanted and she met grey ouside an
      resturant and they decided eat there and talk but when the waiter came
      grey dissepeared and when stephine returned home she talked to her father
      about this and her father thought that it's wierd. He asked stephine if
      she can call him again and she does and he isn't picking up the call. Her
      father wondered if something so urgetn came up since it isn't a matter of
      eating dinner with someone and then ran off. Her father told her to go
      meet him next day. And she was extreamly sad for that. On this side a guy
      named red was wondering what to do in a hospital bed with bandages all
      over his body. His friend came who's name i'll say is luke. He told red
      that he must want to go outside right now. And red says he doesn't
      actually wants to go outside. He's just waiting for his ex to messege him
      and say I'm sorry or something. Luke said that it's just been a day after
      your accident. Must be made out of steel to be able to do that and red
      says unfortunately that steel is made out of calcium. Luke told red about
      a stupid girl in their class named stephine.
      <br />
      <br />
      Red asked if it's important for him to know about her. Did something
      interesting happen? Luke told red to get well soon and red said that he's
      goanna leave this hospital today he already talked with the doctor and
      luke told red that if he's sure and red said he's bored staring at walls
      for all day. He wants to go home cause hospital bed isn't comfy enough.
      Luke says red's bed is littlery rock and it's a mystrey how many pillows
      he have. Red says 10. Red invites luke to dinner to a hotel. There they
      see that stephine left cause some grey named guy suddenly dissepeared. The
      next day when stephine went to school and there she talked to grey and
      they had a nice conversation and red was walking in the school quitely and
      he heard some rumours that stephine believes that a guy named grey exists
      and likes him and red decided to go to the roof top where stephine was
      about to kiss grey but he dissepeared. She was confused. Red asked if
      reality hit her finally. Grey told her to go home and check a therepist
      and left. She went to ask about grey to her friends and she finally
      figured that grey does not exist and she was confused and talked to her
      father about it. All the calls they were all not there and everything. She
      finally visited a therepist and turns out grey was just a imagination of
      her. Ali, arvin, grey They were all part of her imagination.
      <br />
      <br />
      She created depending on her memories which she wanted to happen in real
      life but insted she trapped herself in her own fantacy. She is truamatized
      after her mother's death and then when a guy came to give her comfort she
      wanted to live that life. As the night came she started crying cause she
      was just halusinating and realized that she can now remember that she
      thought about an entire imagination of the personality grey might have.
      he'll come and tell her that he loves her and make her happy again but it
      was all just some imagination. She's sad. Now after making fun of herself
      in the entire class she was sad. Everyone was talking about her imagenery
      boyfriend that fell in love with her in one day. She was really feeling
      ashamed of herself and she never imagined that one day she'll have a hard
      time understanding what reality is in front of her. She spends most of her
      time during lunch at the school roof. Red was at the school roof today and
      talked about how this school roof is open to everyone yet only few come
      her. Maybe in years. Stephine tells red thatt if he's here to make fun of
      her he can and leave. Red says that he very well did laughed at her
      condition cause he can't relate to her. But isn't that exactly what
      happend? No one. Can. So why is she creating a messy fake image or reality
      just case she can't accept it? Just recreating a domain in one's head
      won't do anything. Stephine thanks red for understanding.
      <br />
      <br />
      Red tells stephine that she's the first person grey saw problemed so
      openly since most of the people hide it. She must really want attention.
      Even though she has good friend. Stephine says she doesn't knows if they
      are good. She doesn't understands their jokes and they always laugh at her
      for that. Red told her to get a different set of friend then. Red told
      stephine that once red founded a guy whom he really liked to follow but he
      has someone who liked to talk to another person. They three were like a
      team yet red was the third wheel. Next thing you know red started not
      caring. For attention, for friends and only talked to someone whom he
      wants to right now or he needs to. Now he may not have many friends or any
      followers but he can certainly fit in. Unlike the previous friend group
      where you are just a fill in for npc. Stephine says but her situation is
      different and grey told stephine that exactly. It's never entirely same.
      But red tried his best to relate to her by remembering an past event i
      guess. Grey tells stephine that he's a falure i guess cause trying improve
      himself he has too isolated himself maybe. Now he lacks entertainment so
      she can tell grey her story. Maybe she might not find her lover but at
      least red will find a reason to laugh. Stephine says that even though red
      is saying stuff that can make one angry he's saying it such a way she
      isn't feeling angry. Grey says that who knows.
      <br />
      <br />

      Stephine starts telling grey about her childhood love and everything and
      when she tells grey the school name grey remembers that he used to read in
      that exact school and this made stephine a bit excited. On second look red
      really looks a lot like the person she met. She asks red if he is...Red
      tells her to have a more rational look. Red is a total randome stranger to
      her and just cause one day they met and said some stuff doesn't makes it
      childhood love cause everyday we meet so many people and like it. Now If
      he goes somewhere and liked the way the rikshawala talked would he want to
      marry her if there is any female one in local? Nop cause they are stuff
      said out of kindness and maybe symphyty. Stephine asks what if that little
      kindness is something someone wants for themselves for everything. As if
      all the kindness of the world she's recieving. What if that's what she
      wants. Red tells her that who knows. Those shot of people are picture
      perfect. Don't exists. There will always be different likes. Different
      opinion. Different taste. Different mentality. Stephine asks red that in
      this entire conversation he didn't tried to deny the fact that he isn't
      her grey and grey thinks and says fine. I'm exactly someone you are
      looking for. I do remember someone named s or something who's mother died
      and went depressed. Yes he said some stuff to her but now grey has a
      different opinion about it. After hearing this stephine told red that grey
      exists. And red thought about it and said that red doesn't sounds as a bad
      nickname for coupls for which were are strangers.
      <br />
      <br />
      Red walks away. Then it turned into an absulute classic of how a girl
      likes a guy but the guy keeps rejecting the girl for no reason and is
      annoyed by her and what if we made that the first scean that a girl for no
      reason is too good with a guy and this is the entire history. I certainly
      like the idea. Then came the event what main thing happens. What can
      happen here? Ummmm. Maybe some short of slip. Inspired from western wine
      thingi they stakked glasses which red thinks is dum cause they can anyone
      fall this and in the littler seconds the things falls and grey covered
      stephine's and his own eyes cause they are the only place where it can
      hurt. The glass fell on them but it didn't broke untill it reached the
      ground. Seems like grey got a little cut and stephine asks to use first
      aid and grey showed his hand. Every day for carelessness he get's a
      randome scar. He doesn't needs to create a thousand bandages just for a
      little scrash. The healing factors of the body will automaticky start
      repairing using a wierd liquid that hardens and when it's crispy it's
      extreamly hard to resist picking that up and creating another scar. Red
      tells her that none of those scars were permenent. Just a month later he
      has a clear hand. Stephine tells grey that first aid is good since it
      clears up any infecation that he might regret later and red doesn't cares.
      he already stopped bleeding. Stephine tells red that it's not about that.
      <br />
      <br />
      It seems like it's a weeding party that stephine managed to force her way
      out cause red was there and the usual gang where two girls named aria,
      jessika, luke and another guy who are trying to make red like stephine and
      seems like he just isn't intrested cause her reason isn't something red
      gets. But he sure cares for her cause eversince he met her she's been tied
      to him and he might have started to understand what she means. A little
      then another little then you get addicted to something you cherish so
      much. Something or someone that you know will be there. That's some thing
      red definetely wants but he refuses to do arrenge marrage. His parents
      killed eachother during an argument and he doesn't wants that. During that
      party grey was told to say a speech in front of everyone and he actually
      forgot his speech paper and he decided to confess to make a better
      situation in a wedding and red after so long finally smiled. Red's
      personality is like quet but the person who'll love you in secret and
      won't even let you know how much he cares for you. Then started a fun
      little story about how they live their life and how they managed to get
      together and then when they were travelling to overseas in snow red was
      holding stephine in his arms and wearing a blanket to cover her together.
      It was preety whole some and then at one moment she fell or
      something...no. Her heart rate increased a lot for some reason and red was
      holding her and seeing red in such position she decided to kiss without
      noticing the fact there are people sorrounding them. Then comes the final
      contribute.
      <br />
      <br />
      Where it all ends. Then after a few stories red comes into a conclustion
      of sleeping together and they kissed. But in reality none of the above
      happend. After grey's parent's fought grey's mother killed grey's father
      and grey's father killed her. And the truamatized grey was the only one
      left. Just like the original timeline stephine died out of heartattack.
      And everything was just an imagination of grey who wanted to have a
      wholesome life but he doesn't that's why he wanted to live in fiction that
      he sorrounded himself. Telling himself stories that he may or may not want
      to live.
